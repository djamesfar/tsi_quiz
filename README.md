## About Quiz

Quiz was written for a prospective job opportunity, as a demonstration of my skills in PHP, Laravel, HTML, javascript.
It offers a simple test of the user's spanish vocabulary by providing words in spanish with a list of 5 words in english, one of which is the correct answer.  Clicking the selection (radio button) triggers a submit of the form, where the results are stored in the 'answers' table, which is tied to a unique test and to the users table.
After 10 words, the program shows the test results to the test taker.

- Uses authentication login and registration.
- Uses MySQL database to store words in two related tables.
- Navigation bar has a link for the Quiz, and another to allow adding of the spanish words and their respective english meaning, which are stored in separate tables.
